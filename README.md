Lambda shell - a lambda-backed Linux shell
------------------------------------------

Execute commands hosted and executed by AWS Lambda
via an interactive shell / terminal.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/81321.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/81321)

Requirements:
 - Apex (https://apex.run)
 - Amazon AWS account

# Installation

1. Modify project.json to include your own IAM role.
2. Deploy to AWS with `apex deploy exec`.

# Usage

Execute `lambda-shell`:

```
$ ./lambda-shell
```

This will create a REPL (shell) where commands will be
sent to Lambda and returned to your console.

## Example

```
$ ./lambda-shell
$ uname -a
Linux ip-10-11-194-19 4.1.19-24.31.amzn1.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue Mar 15 23:41:50 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

# Exiting the shell

Exit the shell using Ctrl-C.

# Limitations

* No TTY is allocated. You cannot use `vim`, `emacs`, or even `ex`. Try `ed` or `sed` instead.
* The working path ($PWD) is never modified. (`cd` is not very effective...)A
* No guarantee that commands will land onto the same machine/container. (FEATURE!)
* Writes are ephemeral except to /tmp. (FEATURE!)
